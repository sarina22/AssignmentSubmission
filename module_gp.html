	<h2>REPORT</h2>
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>The project that we are given is about developing   our own website.  Making any website is not as easy as it seems . Website   is the collection of webpages .It is a hypertext document which is connected to the web so that everyone with the internet connection can view the webpages. In this century , we all get information from the different websites but we do not have enough knowledge about how to make any type of website of our. So, this project helps us to get connected with the rest of the world by helping us to build a website of our own. We are basically given six webpages to make. These pages include the main homepage which is our landing page and contains the front cover for the first (overall) view of the website. The next is ”About” page that includes information about us (who we are, things we like and other things that are related to us).In the page”CV” we are given to make our resume ,our experience and any skills that we have.Since, we all use social medias like facebook, Instagram ,linkedin and other widely used medias , the social media links should be kept in the “Social” page. Furthermore, “ Contact” page contains our location and a way for other people to get connected to us by filling up the form and submitting it online. Finally ,  last page is about the report of the overall project we are given.

<h1>Research and teamwork</h1>
<p>Looking the way webpages looked ,it seemed that the webpages were easy to make  but then actually it was a challenging task for the beginner . The project was worth it , it was challenging and made me proud to have my  own website.I gathered ideas  from other websites and tried to create of my own. Actually ended up choosing the simple one for my website because it is easy to learn from the simple and more like a basic one.
</p>


<p> Working  in a group to discuss the design part and the contents that we should be keeping in our webpages was a challenging as well as a fun part. Since, we did not have enough information and ideas to  make the website ,we stumbled upon different others websites from the internet and  we made sketches  from our  overall ideas  and information. We worked in a group of five people .At first we studied the given assignment brief clearly and decided to divide the task into color choosing, animation part, design part ,content part and responsive part . Analyzing all the ideas from our partners we came upon a simple but attractive wireframe for the project.The  sketch of our choice is given below:

<p>To complete the project  a lot of research was done and ideas from various websites were taken. However,  simple and eye friendly website was taken as a reference to the main website being made.</p>

<h1>Experience</h1>
<p>Making webpages was no way easy for me . As I did not have computer subject from school life, it was definitely a challenging task for me . Eventhough, there are many new topics for me yet everything is becoming more and more interesting and creativity has increased as well.</p>
<br>
I agree that coming to college and learning  about the things you are not that familiar with ,is a way more harder than the imagination. I had problems in the beginning of the courses, but soon I got familiar with the subjects.  The task given accordingly has  helped me to understand  the matters even clearer and I have  already feel I have so far from where I was before joining the courses in this college.
<br>
The task given in this term has made me creative and a good research on this project made me to discover new things and make new ideas. Group work, interaction with the module teacher and friends made to be successfully complete my project. Actually, I am so grateful that I got chance to be the part of the task. It really helped me to understand how html and css works.
<br>
Overall, designing a website of my own was a great learning experience. I am thankful for it.
